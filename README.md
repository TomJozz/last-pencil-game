[Last Pencil Game](https://hyperskill.org/projects/341)

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Platform:** JetBrains Academy | **Status:** Completed

**The Last Pencil** is a foundational Java project that implements a classic turn-based game against a highly strategic, AI-controlled opponent (a bot). The objective is to apply core Java concepts while developing game logic, robust input validation, and an optimal winning algorithm.

The game is played with a pile of pencils where players take turns removing **1, 2, or 3** pencils. **The player who takes the last pencil loses.**


This project was a comprehensive exercise in basic Java programming, covering several key areas:

1. **Core Game Engine:** Implemented the main game loop to manage turns and pencil reduction until the game ends.

2. **Robust Input Validation:** Developed detailed checks for initial setup and in-game moves, including:

3. **Strategic Bot Implementation (AI):** The core challenge was programming the opponent (named `Jack`) to follow a perfect, deterministic **winning strategy**.

4. **Java Basics Applied:** Successfully reinforced knowledge of **Introduction to Java**, **Basic literals**, **Writing the first program**, and **Printing data**.

### Final Recap

Although this was a relatively simple project, I kept it engaging by applying clean code principles such as abstraction, separation of concerns, and the strategy pattern. I focused on designing flexible input handling using Java generics and structuring the game logic for extensibility and maintainability.

To ensure reliability and correctness, I practiced **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and wrote comprehensive unit tests using **JUnit 5**, covering AI behavior, input validation, and game flow. One of the key challenges was avoiding repetitive code while preserving clarity â€” I overcame this through functional programming techniques and thoughtful refactoring.

Overall, this project deepened my understanding of writing clean, testable Java code and helped me become more aware of my own learning process and development practices.
