[Last Pencil Game](https://hyperskill.org/projects/341)

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Platform:** JetBrains Academy | **Status:** Completed

---
### Overview

**The Last Pencil** is a foundational Java project that implements a classic turn-based game against a highly strategic, AI-controlled opponent (a bot). The objective is to apply core Java concepts while developing game logic, robust input validation, and an optimal winning algorithm.

The game is played with a pile of pencils where players take turns removing **1, 2, or 3** pencils. **The player who takes the last pencil loses.**

### Key Accomplishments & Features

This project was a comprehensive exercise in basic Java programming, covering several key areas:

1. **Core Game Engine:** Implemented the main game loop to manage turns and pencil reduction until the game ends.

2. **Robust Input Validation:** Developed detailed checks for initial setup and in-game moves, including:

3. **Strategic Bot Implementation (AI):** The core challenge was programming the opponent (named `Jack`) to follow a perfect, deterministic **winning strategy**.

4. **Java Basics Applied:** Successfully reinforced knowledge of **Introduction to Java**, **Basic literals**, **Writing the first program**, and **Printing data**.
